# stylometry-of-baen-books
This is a repository for a stylometry project I worked on titled "The Stylometry of Baen Books Science Fiction Authors." This project takes the form of a semi-formal essay written entirly by myself on my Domain of One's Own domain through the University of Mary Washington and is my final project for ENGL 451B: Reading Literature With Computers. 

The goal of this project was to explore the stylometrics of Baen Books science fiction authors. This approach was inspired by Ben Blatt's Fingerprint method from ***Nabokov's Favorite Word is Mauve***. The ENGL 451B class read Blatt's book early in the semester and were encouraged to try Blatt's methods for our projects, but the fingerprint method was one that really stuck with me. Our professor, Dr. Zach Whalen, created his own version of Blatt's stylometric analysis in Google Colaboratory, which he called ["FingerPrinting."](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10Rnt0gVbIhC0hovpzc-nEB5ZER0oNIwU?usp=sharing) I was inspired by both approaches and decided to do something similar for my final project.

This project was completed using a [Google Colabortory Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) to generate graphs based off an external dataset. The dataset I used was comprised of books from the [Baen Books Free Ebook Library](https://www.baen.com/allbooks/category/index/id/2012), which features over 75 titles from various science fiction and fantasy authors. Every book downloaded was converted to TXT before being uploaded to Colab. For a more in-depth explanation, I have created a sample Colab Notebook void of personal information that can be used as a working guid. This notebook is called ["Stylometric Comparison of Baen Books Science Fiction Authors."](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fUS0jIi3llbKEUiEuHAzCbMqrGE2dVj_#scrollTo=uQMHQT3hHMu8)

Each of the graphs for this analysis were generated using Plotly in Colab before being uploaded to my own personal Plotly account. The code that allows this seemless upload can also be found in my Colab example. These graphs are available to the public and I have uploaded copies of them to this repository. There are three interactive graphs associated with this project. GitHub will not allow me to upload these graphs to the repository, so please view them with the links provided on in my essay post. The three graphs can be found here: [Figure 1: He-Said Graph](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~lclark7/10.embed), [Figure 2: She-Said Graph](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~lclark7/12.embed), and [Figure 3: They-Said Graph](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~lclark7/15.embed).
